# Wine Quality Analysis and Classification 

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning classification** to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties.  
The implementation is done using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the relationship between different wine attributes and quality
- Preprocess the dataset for machine learning
- Train a classification model to predict wine quality
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

---

##  Dataset

- The dataset contains various **chemical properties of wine**, such as:
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free sulfur dioxide
  - Total sulfur dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol
- **Target variable:** `quality`
